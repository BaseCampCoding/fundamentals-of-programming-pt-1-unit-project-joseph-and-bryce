# Randomized Mad Lib - Story game
Basic mad lib game with a twist created with Visual Studio



## Introduction
The projects aim is to be a mad lib, but instead of the user choosing the story the program chooses it for the user. 
The program does not solve any problems really it is mainly an application that appeals to a younger audience.
You can have fun with friends or alone it doesn't matter as long as the user has fun in the end.



## Technologies used
- Visual Studio Codes pt python ver 3.7.9 64-bit/3.8.5 32-bit
- pip install simple-colors 0.1.5
- pip install art 4.8



## Launch
There are not really any technical requirements other than the versions of the software used in the project in the technologies above.



## Features
- Has some simple and complex stories that use user input for answers.
- The user will be given questions or choices related to that specific story which will then be randomly printed.
### To do:
- With the play again option we want it to randomly choose a story after the first story is picked and as the user/s chooses to play again the list will get shorter without choosing the previous stories that were played.
- Have the option to let the user either continue to the next story, quit, or play the current story again.
- Add audio for when a story is printed it plays music related to that story. For example if it was a minecraft story you could play the minecraft theme.
- Add more colors to specific text to let the user know when the story starts and ends.
